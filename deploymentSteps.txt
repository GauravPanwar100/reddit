Steps for deployment react application:--

1. firstly deploy the react app on github by making new repository.
2. now go to package.json file and add below line:--
      "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app", (where myusername is github username and my-app is your app name)
3. now run this command on terminal:-- 
    npm install --save gh-pages
4. Add the following scripts in your package.json:
      "scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",

5. now enter command:--
    npm run deploy

    and this will make a production build and create a build folder inside working app directory.
6. now go to github and go to settings, go to pages and under github pages, you will see that our site is published on that url.
    one important thing to notice is that, we have to wait for 5 mins to perfectly work this url.
